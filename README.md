# Algorithms, DS & LeetCode

My personal repository to practice data structures, algorithms, and LeetCode problems in Python.

## Running the Code

Run scripts as modules from the project root to ensure imports work correctly:

```bash
python -m path.to.module
python -m leetcode.blind75 # blind75
python -m leetcode.potd # problem of the day
```

## Contributing

This is a personal learning project. Suggestions are welcome.
